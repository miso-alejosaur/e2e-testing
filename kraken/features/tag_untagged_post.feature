@user1 @web
Scenario: Como autor creo un post, y despues le agrego un tag
    Given I navigate to page "<HOST>" "ghost/#/signin"
    And I login with credentials "<USERNAME>" "<PASSWORD>"
    And I send a signal to user 2 containing "logged"
    And I wait for 2 seconds
    When I go to tag list
    And I go to new tag form
    And I send a signal to user 2 containing "creating tag"
    And I wait for 2 seconds
    And I create a tag with name "$name_1"
    And I save the tag
    And I send a signal to user 2 containing "tag created"
    And I go to new post form
    And I send a signal to user 2 containing "creating"
    And I wait for 2 seconds
    And I create a post with title "$name_2" and content "$string_1"
    And I send a signal to user 2 containing "posting"
    And I wait for 2 seconds
    And I post the post
    And I send a signal to user 2 containing "post created"
    And I wait for a signal containing "checking" for 30 seconds
    And I wait for a signal containing "checked notag" for 30 seconds
    And I return to posts list

    And I send a signal to user 2 containing "editing"
    And I wait for 2 seconds
