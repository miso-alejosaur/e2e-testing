Scenario:  Como autor creo un tag, y un post con ese tag asignado
    Given I navigate to page "<HOST>" "ghost/#/signin"

    And I send a signal to user 6 containing "logged"
    And I wait for 2 seconds
    When I go to tag list
    And I go to new tag form
    And I send a signal to user 6 containing "creating tag"
    And I wait for 2 seconds
    And I create a tag with name "$name_1"

    And I send a signal to user 6 containing "tag created"
    And I wait for 2 seconds
    And I go to new post form
    And I send a signal to user 6 containing "creating post"
    And I wait for 2 seconds
